1)	What is the advantage of passing values from a function through its parameters rather than through its return value? 

Because we can modify more than one value in a single function

2)	Explain the meaning of the term dereference and identify an example in your code.

Dereference is getting the value that is stored in the memory location pointed by the pointer
Example
decompose(phoneNumber[j], &area, &prefix, &lineNum);
printf("(%3d)-%3d-%4d", area, prefix, lineNum);

3)	Explain what is stored in a pointer variable
