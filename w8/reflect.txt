1) When passing an array to a function is it "by address" or "by value" - explain. by address because the array holds many values


2) Explain why functions with an array parameter are usually complemented with an additional integer parameter (reference specifics in this workshop to explain your answer).
 
3) Why do some of the functions in this workshop specify "const" for the array parameters and not in others?
